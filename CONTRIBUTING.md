# Contributing

This library's only job is to offer a Angular Webpack based Starter package. 
It has no intention to educate on the Angular framework or Webpack package. 

I am not an Angular expert (yet) and I have build this library because:

* Get a better understanding of the Angular framework and Webpack.
* To have an Angular Starter that I understand to work with. 
* To have an Angular Starter with techniques (SASS, LESS etc...) that I use a lot

See the [README](README.md) for more information on how to work with this library and how to modify it to your own liking.

Outstanding issues - [search open issues](https://github.com/github/another-angular-webpack-starter/issues) or create an issue and and I'll help point you in the right direction.
